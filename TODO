sudo removal
------------

chroot/README-buildd.chroot:
  Update add_sbuild_user sudo references
  Update chroot update description

add_sbuild_user:
  Don't copy passwd/group to the chroot; this is handled by schroot
  Don't create chroot work/home directory; have schroot setup script do this, or have sbuild do it at runtime.

Remove chroot_only option, requiring the presence of a chroot.
