Add the ability to disable the current symlinks.

Check packages in the alternatives and stalled_pkg_timeout lists in
the configuration file and Conf.pm.  Make sure they are current and
valid.

sbuild-createchroot should import most of buildd-make-chroot.
(note: only needed for buildd use--accounts and passwords needed for access)

sbuild-createchroot should update the package reference list
(sbuild-checkpackages --set)

Provide a way of generating current reference lists from debootstrapped chroots.
Make sbuild-createchroot create an initial reference list on chroot creation.

Split utility programs into library functions. Functions should operate on
chroot objects, or plain files where appropriate.

Log.pm: Handle nolog case by always opening LOG and PLOG.

Log.pm: Log functions should be generic (writeout of sbuild version/build info
and symlink creation should be customisable).

*/Conf.pm need to be classes.

Chroot.pm: Move chroot naming out of begin_session.

LOG and PLOG should not be in the main namespace; import directly into
namespace needed.

Are 'Build Start Time' and 'Pkg Start Time' different?

sbuild-setup references ~/build, even though not required.

sbuild-setup should document all files copied by schroot setup scripts.

bin/*: Add --help and --version

All programs must use Getopt::Long for options parsing

sbuild-stats option formattion and option processing perform more than
one action at once?  Only set mode once?  actions have multiple args?

run_*_command should take an arrayref instead of a string for running
commands.  They can then be passed directly to schroot avoiding
quoting issues.

Add a --verbose option to all commands

buildd-clean-upload hard-codes $HOME/upload.  Configure location.

All perl programs and modules should
- use strict
- use warnings
- use function prototypes

buildd hard-codes config file locations.  Used in check_reread_config.

buildd hard-codes main::HOME and PATH.  Set in ::Conf.

buildd-watcher should use strftime in place of own functions

sbuild utilities should allow specification of chroot architecture

Sbuild::Chroot should be passed Sbuild::Options directly.

Directory passed to dpkg-source includes Debian version.  Should be upstream only.

Document and add examples for %mailto.

sbuild-adduser should do schroot/sudo-specific setup depending on
$chroot_mode.
