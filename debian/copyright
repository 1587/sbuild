This is Debian's prepackaged version of the build daemon and
associated tools.

The build daemon is maintained as a Debian package by me, Ryan Murray
<rmurray@debian.org>, from the SVN repository,
 http://svn.cyberhqz.com/svn/wanna-build

Everything except andrea (which was written by James Troup) was
originally written by Roman Hodek.
