.SH VERSION
This man page documents the packaged version of wanna\-build.  This version
is maintained by the \fBbuildd-tools\fP project developers on Alioth
(\f[CR]https://alioth.debian.org/projects/buildd\-tools/\fP).
.PP
There is also a version maintained by Ryan Murray which is adapted to build
daemon needs, with similar functionality.  This version should be equally
capable of working in a buildd setup, but has a number of enhancements aimed at
making it suitable for use by end-users.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.SH OVERVIEW
wanna\-build is an automatic distributed build system intended to
recompile Debian binary packages from the Debian source.  The system consists
of seven components:

.PE
.TP
Quinn-Diff
This program determines which packages need to be recompiled.  It is
optional; any program which produces the same output could be used in
its place.  quinn\-diff may be run on the same machine as wanna\-build
or on any other machine.
.TP
Packages
The Packages file from an ftp site (preferablly all build daemons
should use the same ftp mirror as wanna\-build); wanna\-build uses the
information to determine which packages have been installed (after
they've been `uploaded'), and which packages can now be built (after
they've been put on `dep-wait').
.TP
Wanna\-Build
The heart of the build system.  This is a database of packages which
need to be rebuilt.  The packages can be in several states
(e.g. `needs-build', `failed', `dep-wait' etc.).  The database does
full locking, so as long as build daemons and humans all register what
they want to build via wanna\-build, there will be no duplication of
work.
.TP
Build Daemon
The build daemon can be used on a permanently connected machine to
ensure packages are being compiled continuously.  It gets a list of
packages to build from the wanna\-build database and builds them with
sbuild.  The logs of the build are then sent to the human
adminstrator.
.TP
Sbuild
This is the script used to build Debian source packages.
.TP
Adminstrator
Each build daemon must have a human adminstrator who looks at each
build logs and sends a response.  The response can be a signed
..changes file, in which case the build daemon will upload the package,
or it can be a `fail' response along with a reason, in which case the
build daemon will notify the wanna\-build database about the change of
state for the package.
.TP
Developers
Developers can compile and upload packages without duplication of work
if they register their intent with wanna\-build.  Developers are
recommended to use sbuild, pbuilder, or something similar, but there's
nothing that requires this.

.SH DETAILED USAGE
wanna\-build (and its aliases) are intended to better coordinate the package
rebuilding, and to make it easy to determine which packages need
recompilation. This document is a short outline of the usage of the tool.
.PP
wanna\-build comes with a bunch of aliases to it (all in /usr/bin/wb-short),
which save you to type the operation option. Those aliases exist:

 Actions:
  wanna\-build       == wanna\-build --take
  uploaded-build    == wanna\-build --uploaded
  failed-build      == wanna\-build --failed
  give-back-build   == wanna\-build --give-back
  dep-wait-build    == wanna\-build --dep-wait
  forget-build      == wanna\-build --forget
  no-build          == wanna\-build --no-build
 Information:
  build-info        == wanna\-build --info
  list-needs-build  == wanna\-build --list=needs-build
  list-building     == wanna\-build --list=building
  list-uploaded     == wanna\-build --list=uploaded
  list-installed    == wanna\-build --list=installed
  list-failed       == wanna\-build --list=failed
  list-dep-wait     == wanna\-build --list=dep-wait
  list-not-for-us   == wanna\-build --list=not-for-us
  list-all          == wanna\-build --list=all
 Internal (done by cron jobs):
  merge-quinn       == wanna\-build --merge-quinn
  merge-packages    == wanna\-build --merge-packages

.SH DATABASE STATES
wanna\-build maintains a database (/var/lib/wanna\-build/build-db-DIST)
in which it keeps information about all the packages and their
states. These states can be:

  Installed:
    The source and binary version of a package match, no action is
    needed.

  Needs-Build:
    The source version is newer than the binary version for this
				architecture, so the package needs recompilation.

  Building:
    Someone has taken the package and currently builds it.

  Uploaded:
    A previous rebuild has been successfull, and the resulting binary
    package has been uploaded, but it is not installed into the
    archive yet.

  Failed:
    A previous build failed for some reason, and a new version of the
				source package is needed to fix this. This means you don't need
    to try to recompile this version of the package again, it's in
    vain. The "Failed" state is reset if a new source version appears
    (but there are some warnings that it previously failed).

  Dep-Wait:
    A previous build failed because it needs some other package (or newer
    version of) that isn't available yet for this architecture. Along with
    this state a dependency list is stored (normal Depends: syntax and
    features). Once all those dependencies are known to be available (are
    in state Installed and satisfying version requirements if present), the
    package changes state to Needs-Build again.

  Not-For-Us:
    The package isn't suitable for this architecture for some reason.
    (E.g., isdnutils is useless on m68k.) The package is (nearly)
				completely ignored by wanna\-build and never will appear in needs-build
    lists, even if new source versions come up.

  Failed-Removed:
    This is a rather special state... It occurs if a package disappears
    from quinn-diff output and was in state Failed before. Such
    disappearing packages are usually deleted from the database, but state
    Failed packages are treated differently, to avoid loosing the failure
    messages. Therefore they're put into this special state, so that they
    still have an entry, but are otherwise ignored. If was missing from
    quinn-diff due to an error and re-appears later, it will change back
    state to Failed as nothing has happened.

  Dep-Wait-Removed:
    This is similar to Failed-Remove, and this state is entered if a
    package was in Dep-Wait and then disappears from quinn-diff. The state
    is just to prevent loosing the dependency information if the package
    later is listed again (for example, if the disappearance was a
    quinn-diff failure).

  Install-Wait:
  Reupload-Wait:
    These states handle a special case, the delayed-frozen-installation,
    which is described in its own chapter at the end of this document.

A packages changes states by the various calls to wanna\-build. The usual
process is:

 - merge-quinn (run by a cron job) detects that some package needs
   recompilation due to a new source version. The state changes from
   "Installed" to "Needs-Build", and the version number is updated.

 - Somebody notices that the package needs rebuilding, and takes it with

     wanna\-build hello_1.0-1

   The state changes from "Needs-Build" to "Building".

 - The build is successfull and the job is uploaded. Then the uploader
   calls

     uploaded-build hello_1.0-1.dsc

   The package changes state from "Building" to "Uploaded".

 - If the package has been installed into the Debian archive by dinstall on
   master, it will be in the binary-ARCH/Packages file eventually some days
   later. A cron job calls merge-packages and this detects that the version
   that previously was uploaded is now in there and changes the state from
   "Uploaded" to "Installed".

The wanna\-build call in the second step also serves another purpose: It
detects (and tells you) if somebody else already has taken the package (to
avoid double work), or if the package failed previously. The output could
look like:

  $ wanna\-build hello_1.0-1
  hello: NOT OK!
    already taken by rnhodek

or

  $ wanna\-build hello_1.0-1
  hello: NOT OK!
    build of 1.0-1 failed previously:
      Needs a special source patch to compile for m68k (see #99999)

For packages that are not taken yet and have no other specialities, you get
no output except you give the -v (verbose) option.

The arguments you give to wanna\-build, uploaded-build, and failed-build
are rather free-format. The tools just need the package name and the
version number, separated by '_'. Path prefixes and extensions like ".dsc",
".deb", ".changes", ... are ignored. This often allows you to use your
shells filename completion or cut&paste to enter the arguments.

uploaded-build shouldn't fail except the state is wrong (not "Building"),
or you're not the one who has taken the package, or if there is a version
mismatch. But there is no coordination or the like here.

If a build fails (and the error can't be fixed without source
modifications), you should inform your fellows by calling

  failed-build hello_1.0-1

You will be asked for a failure message that will be put in the database.
It can be more than one line. For example:

  Enter reason for failing (end with '.' alone on its line):
  Needs a special source patch to compile for m68k (see #99999)
  .
  hello: registered as failed

The failed messages are also useful for keeping failed lists (list-failed)
and going though it and remembering maintainers about bugs from time to
time. If the package was already in state "Failed", your message will be
appended to the previous one.

If later a new source version is detected by merging quinn-diff output, the
state will be reset to "Needs-Build", assuming that the new source version
fixes the problem. For example, if the new version of hello is 1.0-2 and
you take the package, you'll see:

  $ wanna\-build -v hello_1.0-2
  hello: Warning: Previous version failed!
  hello: ok

This should make you cautious and you can look at the fail message:

  $ build-info hello
  hello:
    Package             : hello
    Version             : 1.0-2
    Builder             : rnhodek
    State               : Building
    Section             : devel
    Priority            : optional
    Previous-State      : Failed
    State-Change        : 1998 Jun 16 16:17:41
    Notes               : out-of-date:libc6
    Old-Failed          : -------------------- 1.0-1 --------------------
   Needs a special source patch to compile for m68k (see #99999)

Now you can look into the changelog of the package and check if bug #99999
really has been fixed. If it seems unlikely that this version will work,
you can immediately call failed-build again.


Besides build-info, there is the --list option or the list-* aliases that
retrieve information from the database. The most commonly used command is
list-needs-build, which tells you which packages are ready for taking. For
example:

  $ list-needs-build
  editors/xemacs19_19.16-9 [important:uncompiled:libc6:X]
  editors/sex_0.16 [optional:uncompiled:libc6:X]
  editors/the_2.5-0.6 [optional:uncompiled:libc6]
  editors/xemacs20_20.4-12 [optional:uncompiled:libc6:X]
  Total 4 package(s)

The output is similar to quinn-diff intentionally. The difference is that
already taken or uploaded or failed packages aren't listed. quinn-diff
can't know these things.

The packages are usually ordered by the following criteria (in this order):

 - out-of-date/uncompiled (the former come first)

 - priority (e.g. "required" before "optional")

 - section (alphabetically)

 - package name (alphabetically)

You can also change the sorting with the -O or --order option. That option
needs an argument that consists of a series of letters. Each letter stands
for one criterium, and the order of the letters decides in which order to
apply these criteria. Available letters are:

 - 'b': builder, alphabetically

 - 'c': out-of-date/uncompiled (out-of-date comes before uncompiled)

 - 'n': package name, alphabetically

 - 'p': priority (required -> important -> ... -> extra)

 - 's': section name, ordered by some kind of importance

 - 'f': failed category (none > uploaded-fixed-pkg > fix-expected >
        reminder-sent > nmu-offered > easy > medium > hard >
								compiler-error)

I.e., the default order would be --order=cpsn. If listing failed packages,
the default order becomes fcpsn.

The other list-* commands can list packages in other states, e.g.
list-uploaded would list all packages that have been uploaded, but are not
installed yet. Or list-building would give you infos on who currently
builds what.

All the list-* commands can also take a -U (--user) option to restrict the
output to a specific user.


Option summary:
===============

Actions and options, as already discussed:

  --take (default)
  -f, --failed
  -u, --uploaded
  -n, --no-build
  -i, --info
  -l STATE, --list=STATE
  --merge-quinn
  --merge-packages
  -O, --order

-v, --verbose
-------------
Be somewhat more verbose, and print revision number at start.

-d DIST, --dist=DIST
--------------------
Set distribution on which wanna\-build should work. There are separate
databases for stable, frozen, and unstable. A default distribution is set
with the variable $default_dist in /etc/wanna\-build.conf. The distributions
"stable", "frozen", "unstable" can be abbreviated as 's', 'f', and 'u',
resp.

--forget
--------
This is another action: The named packages (only name, no version) will be
removed from the database completely. This is for maintainence purposes,
not for day-by-day use. A mail will be sent to the database maintainer.

--give-back
-----------
If you decide to stop building a package that you have taken before (i.e.,
which is in state Building and you're the builder), but that package hasn't
failed, you can give it back with this option. The state changes back to
Needs-Build.

--dep-wait
---------
If you see that a package source-depends on some other package which isn't
available yet for your architecture, you best set the package to state
Dep-Wait. You additionally give a list of dependencies with the -m option,
formatted just like a Depends: field (versioned dependencies are allowed,
but no alternatives). If -m is not used, wanna\-build will ask interactively
for the dependency list. The package is set back to state Needs-Build as
soon as all the dependencies are known to be available (detected by
--merge-packages).

-m MESSAGE, --message=MESSAGE
-----------------------------
Set fail message for --failed. If not set on the command line, wanna\-build
will ask interactively for it.
Set the dependencies that a package should wait for if used with
--dep-wait. Again, wanna\-build will ask interactively for the dependencies
if this option isn't given.

-o, --override
--------------
Take over a package from somebody else. This is possible for packages in
state Building or Failed. The new state will be Building, and the owner
changes. A mail notice will be sent to the previous owner.

-O ORDER, --order=ORDER
-----------------------
Select criteria for how to order --list output (see above).

-U USER, --user=USER
--------------------
Set the user whose name is logged with the transaction, or who will be
entered in the database as builder of the package (--take). The default is
the login name of the caller, but for maintainence purposes it can be
changed on the command line.

-N, --no-propagation
--------------------
Do not propagate a state change to other databases. (Propagation usually
happens if the same version of the package in the same state appears in
another distribution, too). This option is only for special purposes when
propagation wouldn't be correct (it usually is).

-D, --no-down-propagation
-------------------------
Like above, but only inhibit propagation to "lower" (i.e., older)
distributions. For example, a change in frozen would be propagated to
unstable, but not to stable. This option is often used by the build daemon
because it also works only in "up" direction of distros.

-c CATEGORY, --category=CATEGORY
--------------------------------
Set/change the failed category (with --failed) or list only failed packages
in this category (with --list). For more details on failed categories,
please see the file README.failcat.

-a DAYS, --min-age=DAYS
-------------------------
Used together with --list. List only packages whose state change is at
least DAYS ago. Days can be negative, then only packages at most DAYS
old are listed.

--max-age=DAYS
--------------
Same as the above, but specifies a maximum age (same meaning as negative
DAYS in --min-days). DAYS can be negativ here, too, meaning a minimum age
again.


--export=FILE
-------------
Export the internal database (which is in Berkeley DB hash format, to speed
up operation) into an ASCII file. The file format is somewhat similar to a
Packages file, but with different keywords. The --export option is not
intended for public use, but for the database maintainer to view the
contents of the DB directly, or the make manual changes.

--import=FILE
-------------
Import an ASCII format database (as described above) into the internal
database. This is NOT intended for public use. CAUTION: The internal
database is cleared before the import, so that packages can also be deleted
by manual editing. But this also means that you can also easily destroy the
whole DB with this option!

--manual-edit
-------------
Lock the database, export it, start an editor for it, and after the editor
exists, re-import the modified file. Then the db is unlocked again. This
option is meant for manual fixes to the database, with full locking.

--create-db
-----------
Since wanna\-build refuses to open (and thus create) non-existing databases
now, this option is necessary if you really want to create a
not-yet-existing db.

--create-maintenance-lock
-------------------------
This action creates a master lock file for all databases. All operations
except --merge-packages and --merge-quinn will block until this master lock
is gone. The purpose of this lock is to interception of other operation in
the middle of a database update that must be done sequentially for
different distributions, but the merged data nevertheless belong together.
The maintenance lock is used by the do-merge-quinn and do-merge-packages
scripts.

--remove-maintenance-lock
-------------------------
Remove a master lock file again.

--correct-compare
-----------------
Use dpkg --compare-versions for version comparisons, as it is really
correct. However, spawning a dpkg process for every comparison is very
time-consuming, so the default is to use the internal implementation.
(Which has been derived from the dpkg source.)

--introduce-epochs
------------------
This was needed when an old database was updated to contain epochs. As now
all databases should include epochs, this option should be unneeded.


As usual, a double minus ("--") stops option processing, and remaining
arguments will be treated as non-options, even if they start with a '-'.


The delayed-frozen-install problem
==================================

A special problem should be documented here, since wanna\-build tries to
handle it, but nevertheless some manual work is required, and there is a
deficiency you might want to know about.

If a source upload is for frozen and unstable, the source will be installed
in unstable immediately, but before going to frozen it needs manual
acknowledge by the release manager. (The same can also happen if stable is
involved. In the following frozen+unstable will be used as example, but
there are also different combinations to which the problem applies to:
stable+unstable, stable+frozen (unlikely), stable+frozen+unstable.)
Therefore, quinn-diff for unstable will list the package earlier then the
one for frozen, and it will be in Needs-Build in unstable earlier. If now
someone takes the unstable package, the state change is not propagated to
frozen, because there is still an older version in the database. (The same
scenario can also happen if the quinn-diff for frozen isn't updated for a
few days due to malfunctions.)

Now the builder may not upload the package for frozen and unstable, because
he cannot know if the package will be accepted for frozen. So he must
delete frozen from the Distribution: field in the .changes file. (sbuild
does this.) He should also save the .changes file because he will need it
later. (Also this done automatically by sbuild.) But if the package is
accepted for frozen, the new version will become Needs-Build a few days or
so later. To avoid building the same version again as far as this can be
avoided, wanna\-build takes the following actions:

  - If a package comes in from quinn-diff for distribution A and the
    Installed-Version: of the same package in another distribution B is
    equal to the incoming version, the state in distrib A will not be
    Needs-Build but Reupload-Wait.

 - If a package comes in from quinn-diff for distribution A and the
   the same package in another distribution B has the same version number
   and is in states Building or Uploaded, the state in distrib A will not
   be Needs-Build but Install-Wait.

 - If a package comes in from quinn-diff for distribution A and the
   the same package in another distribution B has the same version number
   and the state there is Failed or Dep-Wait, the state from B is copied,
   together with fail messages or dependencies, resp.

 - If during --merge-packages for distribution A the same version of the
   package in another distrib B is in state Install-Wait, the state in B is
   changed to Reupload-Wait.

 - Any time a package changes state to Reupload-Wait, a mail is sent to the
   previous builder that he should reupload the package for the
   distribution in question. The builder is supposed to take the binary
   packages from a Debian mirror, and make a new upload based on the
   .changes he saved after the build for unstable. The Distribution: should
   be what wanna\-build tells him in its mail. (There is a script,
   buildd-reupload, for this task.)

This way, a lot of recompilations of the same version can be avoided.
However, unfortunately, not all of them. If another version for unstable is
installed in the archive before the frozen version comes in from
quinn-diff, the binary packages are already lost and cannot be reuploaded.

.SH FAILURE CATEGORIES
Every package in state Failed can be assigned a category. The
following categories exist:
.IP \[bu]
  easy (e)
.IP \[bu]
  medium (m)
.IP \[bu]
  hard (h)
.IP \[bu]
  compiler-error (c)
.IP \[bu]
  fix-expected (f)
.IP \[bu]
  reminder-sent (r)
.IP \[bu]
  nmu-offered (n)
.IP \[bu]
  uploaded-fixed-pkg (u)
.PP
Additionally, a special category `none' is used if no category has
been assigned.
.PP
Usually, if a package failed recompilation, you report a bug and set
it to Failed. Now you should also assign a category to this failed
package. "easy" is for more or less trivial bugs, like typos or the
like. "medium" is for things that require a bit more effort (e.g.,
writing new configs for your arch) but are still doable with a normal
NMU. "hard" is meant for things that need special bootstrapping, for
programs that segfault and need debugging, and so on. If you know the
package maintainer to fix reported bugs quickly and reliably, you can
also use "fix-expected" as category.

You can assign a category directly with wanna\-build:

  failed-build -c easy some-pkg_1.0-1

or

  wanna\-build -c easy some-pkg_1.0-1

You can also use one-letter abbreviations for the categories, as
mentioned above in parens. Another way to assign a category is to
include them in the fail message, probably the one that you send back
to the build daemon. If the message starts with [XXX], the XXX will be
interpreted as a category and be assigned to the package. Of course,
you can use the abbreviations here, too. You can also change an
existing category by including a new one in a fail message (that will
be appended). That inclusion into a message is usually the most
convenient way to set or change a category.

From time to time you should make a bug fixing session to check for
old, unfixed bugs. You can easily list such failed packages with the
new --min-age=DAYS (-a) option of wanna\-build. For example, I
regularily do

  list-failed -a 14

to list all failed packages that haven't been fixed in the last 14
days. The listing is sorted by categories. You probably can ignore
"hard" packages (except you have lots of spare time now :-)

For packages that are "easy" or "medium", you can send a reminder to
the maintainer and change the category to "reminder-sent". If a
package is in that category for several days and the maintainer still
didn't respond, you should offer to make a NMU if there is no
reaction. The category changes to "nmu-offered". If a package has that
label and is older than (e.g.) 21 days, you really should do the NMU
now.

Of course, the timings are more or less a subjective choice, and also
can very with importance of the failed package. Simply use common
sense. For really old bugs, you obviously also can skip the reminder
phase.

If the maintainer replies to a bug report and says he is actively
working on a fix, a good new category is "fix-expected". With this you
note for yourself that a reminder and NMU offer is probably not
necessary (except the package is for too long in this state...)

If the maintainer says that he already has uploaded a fixed version
(or is about to do this), you can set the category to
"uploaded-fixed-pkg". This again is a note for your bug tracking.

The above to actions can be easily done with the Emacs functions
buildd-bug-change-category (C-c C-a C-c) and buildd-comment (C-c C-a
C-a). They both can be called in a reply to the bug report, provided
that the maintainer left the subject unchanged, i.e. it still is in
the form

  Re: Bug#XXXX: PACKAGE_VERSION(DIST): blabla

Those infos are needed to construct a mail with correct subject to
buildd that will call failed-build then. Obviously, you can also
change the category with buildd-bug-comment, by including [CATEGORY]
in the text to be appended.
